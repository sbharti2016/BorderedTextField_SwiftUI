# BorderedTextField_SwiftUI

In SwiftUI, a custom bordered input textfield control refers to a user interface element designed to gather text input with a distinctive border style. This specialized text input control allows developers to create a unique visual representation for text entry fields. It typically includes the ability to customize the border color, border width, corner radius, and possibly other visual attributes to align with the overall design language of an application. The bordered input textfield control serves as a visually appealing and functional component within the app's user interface, offering a personalized and consistent look for gathering text input from users.
